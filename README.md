HTML,CSS
This HTML document creates a minimalist version of the Google homepage with integrated CSS for styling and layout. The head section sets up the character encoding and viewport for responsiveness, and assigns a title to the page. The CSS defines the page's overall aesthetic, starting with a light gray background for the body and center-aligning text and elements. The .container class styles a centered, white box with rounded corners and a subtle shadow to hold the content. Within this container, the .logo class provides spacing below the Google logo image. The .search-box class centers a text input field, styled with padding, a light gray border, and rounded corners to mimic Google's search bar. The .search-buttons class styles two buttons below the input field with padding, rounded corners, and a light background that darkens slightly on hover, enhancing interactivity. Each button is designed to blend seamlessly with the layout, providing a clear and user-friendly interface for search functionality. Overall, the design emphasizes simplicity and clean lines, capturing the essence of Google's classic search page.
